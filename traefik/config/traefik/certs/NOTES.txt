## JAVA 8
keytool -importcert -alias <server_name> -keystore <JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/security/cacerts -file public.crt

## JAVA 11

keytool -importcert -alias jira.fires.division -keystore /opt/java/openjdk/lib/security/cacerts -file jira.fires.division.crt


## CONTAINERS
You will need to docker exec into each atlassican container and push the correct 'server' cert into the java cacert file.  This will
allow java to trust the self signed cert.

TODO: Look into possibly mounting the cacert to a volume that always has the correct certs loaded.  This is because each time the cantainer 
is recreated, the cacerts are reset back to the original image.

### LOCAL WORKSTATION
#In order for MVN to use Nexus.  You must copy the self signed nexus certificate into the local java cacerts.

Need to configure NPM to ingore SSL error
npm config set strict-ssl=false

TODO: Investigate way add/point NPM to cacert certificate store
